# Canada-Jobs-Web-Scraper

This is a web scraper that extracts the title, location, business, salary, number of vacancies, data, job ID, NOC number, and the hours per week of jobs located in Ontario.

To run this scraper, you must have:
- Python 3
- Scrapy (just do *pip install scrapy* in your command prompt after installing Python)

Simply clone my repository in your personal computer, then use the command prompt to get to this directory. Then, run 
*scrapy crawl recursion -o canada_jobs.csv* in your command prompt. This exports a csv file with the aforementioned data.
Enjoy!
